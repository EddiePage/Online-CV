				<h2>IT is in my blood</h2>
				<p>I am the third generation in my family with a passion for IT. My grandfather worked on the very first computer systems integrated into industry, so did my father whom later went on to become an IT specialist. I was born with it, it runs in my veins. I love all things technology wise be it software or hardware. I have a passion for coding and finding solutions to problems. Organizing, structuring and using data is always enjoyable. I am also an avid gamer and enjoy building desktops. </p>

				<h2>The need for speed</h2>
				<p>When I am not behind my desk working then I do enjoy being behind the wheel and driving. I am and always have been an enormous fan of cars, so when the opportunity arose to complete an advance driving course I grabbed the bull by the horns. In life one has to work hard but play hard too. While also gaining skills, learning and always growing in the process too. Please Click on the picture of the car to learn more about advance driving courses.</p>

				<h2>Nature vs. Nurture</h2>

The human body and mind has needs to rest and recharge, for me there is nothing like a short trip into the gorgeous nature of the world and then seeing it from a diffrent vantage point. That's when I found about the Oribi gorge swing. The tallest gorge swing in the world where your free fall over 100m and swing up too 300m. Please click on the waterfall to witness what event is like.</p>
